;;; Commentary:

;; Migemo extension of `anything'. Use `anything-migemo' instead of
;; `anything'. If `anything-migemo' is invoked with prefix argument,
;; `anything' is migemo-ized. This means that pattern matching of
;; `anything' candidates is done by migemo-expanded `anything-pattern'.

;; If you want to use migemo search source-locally, add (migemo) to
;; the source. It sets match and search attribute appropriately for
;; migemo.

;;; Setting:

;; (require 'anything-config)
;; (require 'anything-migemo)
;; (define-key global-map [(control ?:)] 'anything-migemo)

;;; Bug:

;; Simultaneous use of (candidates-in-buffer), (search
;; . migemo-forward) and (delayed) scrambles *anything* buffer. Maybe
;; because of collision of `migemo-process' and `run-with-idle-timer'
