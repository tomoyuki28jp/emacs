;;; Commentary:

;; From RFC 2616

;; 3.3.1 Full Date
;;
;;    HTTP applications have historically allowed three different formats
;;    for the representation of date/time stamps:
;;
;;       Sun, 06 Nov 1994 08:49:37 GMT  ; RFC 822, updated by RFC 1123
;;       Sunday, 06-Nov-94 08:49:37 GMT ; RFC 850, obsoleted by RFC 1036
;;       Sun Nov  6 08:49:37 1994       ; ANSI C's asctime() format
;;
;;    The first format is preferred as an Internet standard and represents
;;    a fixed-length subset of that defined by RFC 1123 [8] (an update to
;;    RFC 822 [9]). The second format is in common use, but is based on the
;;    obsolete RFC 850 [12] date format and lacks a four-digit year.
;;    HTTP/1.1 clients and servers that parse the date value MUST accept
;;    all three formats (for compatibility with HTTP/1.0), though they MUST
;;    only generate the RFC 1123 format for representing HTTP-date values
;;    in header fields. See section 19.3 for further information.
;;
;;       Note: Recipients of date values are encouraged to be robust in
;;       accepting date values that may have been sent by non-HTTP
;;       applications, as is sometimes the case when retrieving or posting
;;       messages via proxies/gateways to SMTP or NNTP.
;;
;;    All HTTP date/time stamps MUST be represented in Greenwich Mean Time
;;    (GMT), without exception. For the purposes of HTTP, GMT is exactly
;;    equal to UTC (Coordinated Universal Time). This is indicated in the
;;    first two formats by the inclusion of "GMT" as the three-letter
;;    abbreviation for time zone, and MUST be assumed when reading the
;;    asctime format. HTTP-date is case sensitive and MUST NOT include
;;    additional LWS beyond that specifically included as SP in the
;;    grammar.
;;
;;        HTTP-date    = rfc1123-date | rfc850-date | asctime-date
;;        rfc1123-date = wkday "," SP date1 SP time SP "GMT"
;;        rfc850-date  = weekday "," SP date2 SP time SP "GMT"
;;        asctime-date = wkday SP date3 SP time SP 4DIGIT
;;        date1        = 2DIGIT SP month SP 4DIGIT
;;                       ; day month year (e.g., 02 Jun 1982)
;;        date2        = 2DIGIT "-" month "-" 2DIGIT
;;                       ; day-month-year (e.g., 02-Jun-82)
;;        date3        = month SP ( 2DIGIT | ( SP 1DIGIT ))
;;                       ; month day (e.g., Jun  2)
;;        time         = 2DIGIT ":" 2DIGIT ":" 2DIGIT
;;                       ; 00:00:00 - 23:59:59
;;        wkday        = "Mon" | "Tue" | "Wed"
;;                     | "Thu" | "Fri" | "Sat" | "Sun"
;;        weekday      = "Monday" | "Tuesday" | "Wednesday"
;;                     | "Thursday" | "Friday" | "Saturday" | "Sunday"
;;        month        = "Jan" | "Feb" | "Mar" | "Apr"
;;                     | "May" | "Jun" | "Jul" | "Aug"
;;                     | "Sep" | "Oct" | "Nov" | "Dec"
;;
;;       Note: HTTP requirements for the date/time stamp format apply only
;;       to their usage within the protocol stream. Clients and servers are
;;       not required to use these formats for user presentation, request
;;       logging, etc.
