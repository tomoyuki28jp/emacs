Egg is an experimental clone of Magit

MAGIT:
======

Magit is an interface to the version control system Git, implemented
as an extension to Emacs by Marius Voller.

Please find his code at: http://zagadka.vm.bytemark.co.uk/magit


EGG:
=====

The design and most ideas in Egg was borrowed/stolen from Magit.

Egg is Magit pushed to the side of funky UI while Magit was more about
functionalites.


The END.
