TO USE:

1. install required packages
[example for ubuntu users]:
sudo apt-get install emacs-snapshot-gtk emacs-snapshot-el emacs-env-ja \
emacs-goodies-el slime elscreen tramp wl migemo w3m ispell imagemagick 

[note]: Probably you don't need the "emacs-env-ja" package.

2. git clone git://github.com/tomoyuki28jp/emacs.git ~/.emacs.d

3. ln -s ~/.emacs.d/.emacs ~/

4. if you want to use rcirc, create auth-rcirc.el file.
(Actually, you don't have to do this. But without creating the 
 config file, you will have to type your user name and password 
 every time you start rcirc.)

[example]:
~/.emacs.d/.auth/auth-rcirc.el
(setq rcirc-authinfo
      `(("freenode"  nickserv "user" "pass")
        ("localhost" bitlbee  "user" "pass")))

[note]: 
In order to use bitlbee, you have to install bitlbee 
(apt-get install bitlbee), setup bitlbee correctly
and register your user name and password.
